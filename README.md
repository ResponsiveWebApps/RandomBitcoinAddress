# RandomBitcoinAddress
Generates random Bitcoin private key, public key, address and tests validation. On both live and test networks.<br />
Developed using Nodejs and Bitcore module.<br />
Node modules missing repository. Need to delete nodes_modules folder and create node project from begining.<br />
Installing from bower did not prosuce the right files needed for project. Had to find the right bower components.
<br />
npm install bitcore<br />
bower install bitcore
