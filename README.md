# RandomBitcoinAddress
<http://responsivewebapplications.com/sb/RandomBitcoinAddress/> <br />
Generates random Bitcoin private key, public key, address and tests validation. On both live and test networks.<br />
Developed using the Bitcore module for NodeJS and Bower.<br />
Example is hosted on a generic cPanel shared server. Node modules were not installed but Bower still works.
Installing from bower did not prosuce the right files needed for project. Had to find the right bower components.
<br />
npm install bitcore<br />
